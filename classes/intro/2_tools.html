                    ## Tools of this course
                    As you can guess a lot of handy tools have arised since ML
                    has become so popular. We will introduce here some of them
                    in this first class.
                    ---
                    ## Python
                    Python is a popular programming language and it is the one
                    we will work with for several reasons:
                    - It is beginner friendly and easy to use.
                    - The community is huge.
                    - Numerous tutorials, helps available on internet.
                    - The ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools is enormous and growing.
                    --
                    ## Python
                    As mentionned earlier the number of handy libraries is quite significant.
                    Here are some of interests for this course:
                    - [numpy](https://numpy.org/): fundamental package for scientific computing
                    - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): data analysis and manipulation tool
                    - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis
                    - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [plotly](https://plotly.com/): vizualisations tools
                    - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): powerful deep learning framework
                    --
                    ## Python
                    If you have no prior knowledge on Python or need a little bit of refreshment
                    here is a short introduction tutorial:

                    <div style="text-align:center"><iframe width="540" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqtD5dpn9C8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

                    Or if you rather want to read you can go to the [official python beginner tutorial](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers)
                    ---
                    ## Git and GitHub
                    <div style="text-align:center"><img width="200" height="52" alt="GitHub Logotype" class="height-auto" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Logo.png"></div>


                    > "GitHub  is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control
                    > using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) 
                    > functionality of Git, plus its own features."

                    Note that:
                    - **Git** is a [Version Control System](https://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control)
                    - **GitHub** is a Git server

                    --
                    ## Git and GitHub
                    Do not worry we won't require an exhaustive knowledge of `git` and **GitHub** just some basis.
                                            
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_branch.png" width="80%" height="auto"></div>

                    - Save it somewhere safe and easy to access
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    - Generate a SSH key pair, to do so open a command shell:
                        - (Linux/MacOS users):
                        ```shell
                        ~/firstname.name$ ssh-keygen
                        ```
                        - (Windows users):
                        ```shell
                        C:\Users\firstname.name> ssh-keygen
                        ```
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    You should see a message that looks like this:
                    ```shell
                    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
                    Enter file in which to save the key (C:/Users/firstname.name/.ssh/id_rsa):
                    ```
                    You can press enter if you do not have already a SSH key, otherwise type:
                    `C:/Users/firstname.name/.ssh/id_aibt`.

                    The following should be prompted:
                    ```shell
                    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
                    ```
                    Simply press Enter, it will ask you to repeat -> Press Enter again
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    If you go to the given location (`C:/Users/firstname.name/.ssh/`), you should have at least two files:
                    - `id_rsa` or `id_aibt`
                    - `id_rsa.pub` or `id_aibt.pub`
                    They are respectively your private and public SSH key (do not hesitate to ask if you have no idea of what it is).
                    Do not forget that you should **never** share your **private** key!
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    Now, go to your Settings
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_settings.png" width="700" height="auto"></div>
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    Go to SSH and GPG keys
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_settings_pc_2.png" width="700" height="auto"></div>
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    Click on the button `New SSH key`
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_settings_pc_3.png" width="700" height="auto"></div>
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    You should be on a page that looks like this:
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_settings_pc_4.png" width="700" height="auto"></div>
                    You can give a title to your SSH key (whatever you like). Then you should open with a text editor
                    your public SSH key file and copy the content of this file.
                    --
                    ### Exercise (On your own computer)
                    <div text-align="center"><img src="imgs/git_settings_pc_4.png" width="700" height="auto"></div>
                    Next, you should paste it in the `Key` field on GitHub. Finally, you should click on the button `Add SSH key`!
                    ---
                    ### Exercise (Linux/MacOS users)
                    Congrats 🎉🔥! We are now ready to set our working environment and to download the repository which
                    will contain all the course materials. In order to do so, we will now open a command shell!
                    ```shell
                    ~/firstname.name$
                    ```
                    If you have never touch a shell in your life, this [cheat sheet](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/unix_cheatsheet.html) may interest you!

                    ## Git and GitHub
                    ### Get course materials (Linux/MacOS users)
                    We first need to `clone` the repository

                    If you registered an SSH key:
                    ```shell
                    ~/firstname.name$ git clone git@github.com:lucashervier/aibt.git
                    ```

                    Else: 
                    ```shell
                    ~/firstname.name$ git clone https://github.com/lucashervier/aibt.git
                    ```
                    If your are on the ISAE's computer the command shell will ask you for your credentials *i.e* you GitHub id
                    and the token we previously created.
                    If it is on your personal computer, nothing should be asked as we added the SSH key to our GitHub profile!
                    --
                    ### Get course materials (Linux/MacOS users)
                    The course is downloaded, it is now time to go to your course folder
                    ```shell
                    ~/firstname.name$ cd aibt
                    ```
                    Now, you can try to go to the review of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python folder.
                    ```shell
                    ~/aibt$ cd 00_oop
                    ```
                    For practical reasons, we recommend that for each lessons to copy and rename the `.ipynb` files to `student_filename.ipynb`. Do not worry to lose
                    the original file it will appear again once you use `git pull`.
                    --
                    ### Get course materials (Linux/MacOS users)

                    Lessons would be added for every lesson. In order to get it you will need to go back
                    to the aibt folder location and to make a `git pull` command.
                    ```shell
                    ~/00_oop$ cd ..
                    ~/aibt$
                    ```
                    Once there at the beginning of every class you should do a `git pull` to get the updates of the courses
                    ```shell
                    ~/aibt$ git pull
                    ```
                    ---

                    Congrats 🎉🔥! We are now ready to set our working environment and to download the repository which
                    will contain all the course materials. In order to do so, we will now open a command shell (research bar -> Command)!
                    ```shell

                    ```

                    If you registered an SSH key:

                    Lessons would be added for every lesson. In order to get it you will need to go back
                    to the aibt folder location and to make a `git pull` command.
                    ```shell
                    C:\Users\firstname.name\Documents\aibt\00_oop> cd ..
                    C:\Users\firstname.name\Documents\aibt>
                    ```
                    Once there at the beginning of every class you should do a `git pull` to get the updates of the courses
                    ```shell
                    C:\Users\firstname.name\Documents\aibt> git pull
                    ```

                    ## Setting up your working environment (ISAE's machines)
                    As a good practice, it is nice to have a Python environment per project, especially to avoid
                    inconvenient versionning conflict.
                    ```shell
                    ~/aibt$ module load python/3.7
                    ~/aibt$ python -m venv aibt_venv 
                    ```
                    We just created a virtual environment for Python, we will now activate this environment
                    (don't forget to do it every time).
                    ```shell
                    ~/aibt$ . aibt_venv/bin/activate
                    (aibt_venv) ~/aibt$
                    ```
                    --
                    ## Setting up your working environment (ISAE's machines)
                    Now we have an empty Python environment! We will add the libraries we previously talked about
                    ```shell
                    (aibt_venv) ~/aibt$ pip install -r requirements.txt
                    ```
                    We are soon ready to tackle our first Use Case !

                    ## What To remember (Linux/MacOS Users)
                    - At the beginning of each course go to your aibt folder and get all the updates:
                    ```shell
                    ~/firstname.name$ cd aibt
                    ~/aibt$ git pull
                    ```
                    - Go to the class folder, copy and rename the `.ipynb` files to `student_filename.ipynb` and run the student one.

                    ## What To remember (Linux/MacOS Users)
                    - Activate your virtual environment
                    ```shell
                    ~/aibt$ conda activate aibt_venv
                    (aibt_venv) ~/aibt$
                    ```
