						## Class format

						Welcome to the AIBT Hands-on first class  ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ‰!

						During this first class we will introduce a certain number of tools that will be incredibly
						useful for the entire year we will spend together! Each class will contain the following elements:
						- a short introduction (maybe except for this one)
						- one or several practical notebook(s) (if you don't know what it is it will come)
						- an evaluation

						In addition, since this year is the first one we will ask you a short feedback once a class is over in order to
						incrementally build something that fits you better!

						## Definitions
						Nowadays, there is a lot of "buzz" words which are often mixed or wrongly used:
						- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Is actually a vast research domain which can include
						Genetic Algorithm, Meta Heuristics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning
						- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Is only a subdomain of AI.
						- **DeepLearning**: It is Machine Learning with Deep Neural Networks
						- **BigData**: It is the fact to process a huge quantity of data. It does not imply the use of any 
						artificial intelligence techniques

						## Definitions
						**Data Scientist**: Often wrongly used and is expected to do "magic tricks" with some data.
						
						| Data Engineer      | Data Scientist    | Data Analyst      |
						|:------------------ |:----------------- |:----------------- |
						| "Data engineers build and optimize systems that allow data scientists and data analysts to work. [...] Data engineers ensure that data is properly received, transformed, stored, and made accessible to other users" | "Data scientists are specialists who apply their expertise in statistics and building machine learning models to make predictions [...] the data scientist has the duty to process data into insight." | "Data analysts provide value to their companies through data, using it to answer questions and communicate results to help business decisions." |

						## Scope of this course
						In this course we will mainly focus on:
						- Machine Learning
						- A Data Scientist journey
						- Even though the statistical theory is fun, we will have a very practical approach
						- Since it is the first year of this course, suggestions will be warmly welcomed !

						## Machine Learning
						What is machine learning ?

						> Machine Learning is "the use and development of computer systems that are able to
						> learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using	algorithms and 
						> statistical models to analyse and draw inferences from patterns in data"
						>
						> <div style="text-align:right"><cite><a href="https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/">- Oxford Languages</a></cite></div>

						## Machine Learning
						### 3 Main Learning types:

						|                  | Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning (RL) |
						| :--------------: | :------------------ | :-------------------- | :-------------------------- |
						| Available data   | $\{(x, y)\}$ | $\{x\}$ | $\{(x, u, r, x')\}$ |
						| Objective        | Learn a function: $f(x) = y$ | Find groups and correlations: $x \in C$ | Optimal Control: $f(x) = u \| max(\sum(r))$ |
						| Applications ex  | Detect tumor, predict prices | Clusterize end-users | Video Games, Robotics |

						Today class will focus on data exploration for a supervised regression task!
						But first we will talk a little bit about the [necessary tools](https://lucashervier.github.io/aibt-slides/1_introduction/2_tools.html)
